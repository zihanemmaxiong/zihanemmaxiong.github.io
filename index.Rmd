Hi, I'm **Zihan Xiong** ðŸ‘‹  
I'm a second-year Master of Public Health student in Epidemiology at **Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health**.  

My research interests center on **electronic health record (EHR)â€“based analytics**, **real-world evidence (RWE)**, and the application of **AI and conversational models** to improve early cancer detection and clinical decision-making.  
Currently, my thesis focuses on developing and evaluating an EHR-based alert system to enhance **genetic testing uptake among breast cancer patients**, bridging population health and precision medicine.  

I'm passionate about leveraging data-driven methods to make healthcare more equitable, efficient, and personalized.  
Feel free to explore my work or connect with me through GitHub or LinkedIn!
